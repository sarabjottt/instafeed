# Instagram-Feed
A simple customizable Javascript to fetch Instagram images dynamically on a website.

## Requirement
You will need `access_token` from Instagram, by registering at [Instagram Developer](http://instagram.com/developer/register/) for a developer acccount.

## Usage 

Make a empty div with id of `instagram-feed`. 

Replace the default `token` with one of your own
`let token = "your_own_access_token";`

Replace the default `count` with the number of images you want to show.
` let count = 8;`
